We the team "Trace X" developed a fully functional Line Follower Car. 
The hardware details along with the Circuit Diagram and WorkFlow is given in the "TraceX-line Follower.doc". 
An additional battery charging module - TP4056 has also been used along with all the other components mentioned in the document, to charge the Lithium ion battery. 
The algorithm used to control and operate the system is given in the "Line Follower.ino" file. 
The given program can be used on any version of Arduino IDE. The dependencies it requires to be pre-installed are: 1. AFMotor Library (for motor control) 2. QTRSensors Library (for line sensor reading)
The pathway/steps to install these libraries is: 
1. Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries
2. Search for "Adafruit Motor Shield"
3. Install "Adafruit Motor Shield library" by Adafruit
4. Search for "QTRSensors"
5. Install "QTRSensors" by Pololu
